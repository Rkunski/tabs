        <p>I started learning Judo few years ago it was after my bodybuilding expierience. I got interest in it, because i always wanted to increase my mobility and my body limits. Practising in Judo made me much stronger, increased my endurance, also got some discipline.
        There are seven diffent belts in Europe: White, Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, Brown and Black.
      All belts have ranks White one is 6 kyo, Brown one 1 kyo, starting from Black belt rank changes to DANs, starting from 1.</p>
